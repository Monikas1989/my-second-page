# my-second-page
This page is next exercise of my training - YouCode.
There is more code used than earlier, more work and more skills.
This page is in polish language. I used a few graphics there, picture and a table.
I've made a interactive button whose can change the background color and I added navigation for two lists, whose takes us to another page for more informations about this list item.

## About page
This page is about "The best bands rock/heavy metal at 80s and 90s". I mentioned a few musical bands and we can "click" and listen a song ( on You Tube), whose we choose. 
Click my demo link and have a good fun.
